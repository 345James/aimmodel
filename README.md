# BizTalk Migrator

This repository contains the application model used by the BizTalk Migrator to migrate to Azure Integration Services.
This model represents an integration solution, which feeds into a code generator that will
produce a deployable Azure application from it.

The BizTalk Migrator is a command-line tool that helps migrate BizTalk applications to Azure.
This is implemented across several GitHub repositories - aimcore, aimmodel, aimtool, aimazure, and aimbiztalk.
The documentation for the tool is available at the following link in the aimtool repository:

- [aimtool](https://github.com/Azure/aimtool/blob/main/docs/README.md)
