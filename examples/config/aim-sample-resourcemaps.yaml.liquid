#
# A target model is produced by analyzing the source model and adding logical messaging
# objects that represent the source model artifacts.
#
# As part of the analysis stage, each logical messaging object is associated with a resource
# map key.  This key is used to look up the resources in this configuration file and
# associated template configuration files and the discovered resources are added to the target model.
#
# The configuration files themselves can also be rendered using the Liquid template language.
#

# A resource map defines a grouping of resources by logical messaging object.  The associated resources
# are defined in the resources key in this configuration file.
