#
# A target model is produced by analyzing the source model and adding logical messaging
# objects that represent the source model artifacts.
#
# As part of the analysis stage, each logical messaging object is associated with a resource
# map key.  This key is used to look up the resources in this configuration file and
# associated template configuration files and the discovered resources are added to the target model.
#
# The configuration files themselves can also be rendered using the Liquid template language.
#

# A resource associates the templates that are used to represent and deploy the resource in Azure
# keyed by the AIS target environment.  The target environment is an enumeration defined in the model
# and determines what environment the templates support.
